#  Project description

The app fetches posts from the mock api service https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/, it shows post titles on the main page, and shows more details like author and comments on the detail pages. The data is cached as it's received from the server.

# Tasks

## Fix bugs
1. Tapping on posts doesn't open detail view
2. Descriptions do not show up in the detail view 
3. Comments are not always correctly fetched and displayed

## Review Architecture
- What would you do differently

## Write tests
- Freeform, start with most impactful areas
- What tests would you add if you had more time?
- What would you change in code to make it more testable?
